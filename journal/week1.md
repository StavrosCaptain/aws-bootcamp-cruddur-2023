# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Required Homework

### 1) Frontend and Backend Containerization

Backend Containerization was completed by writing a dockerfile as depicted in figure below:

Frontend Containerization was completed by writing a dockerfile which is located [here](https://github.com/StavrosCaptain/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/frontend-react-js/Dockerfile).

Finally, we wrote a docker-compose.yml file which is located [here](https://github.com/StavrosCaptain/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/docker-compose.yml).

After the "compose up" command we have specific ports running as below (except from port 5432, which is for postgres and we configure it below):
